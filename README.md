# Spatial skin atlas (used for Hidden immune memory niches in inflammatory skin diseases)

In this study, we generated a spatially-resolved multi-modal molecular atlas of ~3.4 million human skin cells (including 113 skin sections profiled using Xenium-5k) and applied deep learning to unbiasedly decode 26 skin niches in health and disease. Several disease-associated niches corresponded to known histopathological features, and we defined their cellular and molecular features, co-localisations, and interactions. Additionally, we discovered novel disease-associated niches, potentially contributing to inflammatory memory, that are not identifiable using standard histopathological analysis.
